I want you to design the user interface for a feature spec using the following MULTI-PHASE process and instructions.

This command creates HTML mockups with DaisyUI components and data contracts that bridge the gap between your spec.md and implementation. The output provides concrete visual targets for implementation agents.

Carefully read and execute the instructions in the following files IN SEQUENCE, following their numbered file names. Only proceed to the next numbered instruction file once the previous numbered instruction has been executed.

Instructions to follow in sequence:

{{PHASE 1: @agent-os/commands/design-ui/1-resolve-spec.md}}

{{PHASE 2: @agent-os/commands/design-ui/2-create-ui-spec.md}}
