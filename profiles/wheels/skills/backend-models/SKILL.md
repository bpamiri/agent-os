name: Backend Models
description: Design and implement ORM models with validations, associations, and callbacks. Use when creating model files, defining hasMany/belongsTo relationships, adding validation rules, or implementing custom model methods. Apply when working on .cfc model files, configuring primary keys, adding beforeSave/afterCreate callbacks, or troubleshooting model-related errors. Essential for any data layer work.

# Backend Models

## When to use this skill:

- When creating new model files or modifying existing models
- When defining model associations (hasMany, belongsTo, hasOne, hasManyThrough)
- When adding validation rules (validatesPresenceOf, validatesUniquenessOf, validatesFormatOf)
- When working on files in `models/` or `app/models/` directories
- When implementing model callbacks (beforeSave, afterCreate, beforeValidation)
- When configuring table names and primary keys with table() and setPrimaryKey()
- When adding custom model methods for business logic
- When using model finders (findAll, findOne, findByKey) with includes and ordering
- When troubleshooting "Component has no accessible Member" or association errors
- When implementing soft deletes or counter caches

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend models.
