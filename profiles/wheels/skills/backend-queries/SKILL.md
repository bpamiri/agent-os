name: Backend Queries
description: Write efficient and secure database queries using ORM methods. Use when constructing findAll/findOne queries, adding where clauses, implementing pagination, or optimizing query performance. Apply when working with model queries, eager loading associations with include, preventing N+1 query problems, or writing raw SQL when needed. Also use when debugging slow queries or implementing search functionality.

# Backend Queries

## When to use this skill:

- When writing findAll(), findOne(), or findByKey() queries
- When adding where clauses and query conditions
- When implementing pagination with page and perPage parameters
- When optimizing queries with eager loading (include parameter)
- When preventing N+1 query problems in loops
- When implementing search or filtering functionality
- When ordering and sorting query results
- When using select to limit returned columns
- When writing raw SQL with queryExecute() or execute()
- When debugging slow queries or analyzing query performance
- When implementing complex joins or subqueries

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend queries.
