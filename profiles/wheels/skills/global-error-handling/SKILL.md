name: Global Error Handling
description: Implement robust error handling following project patterns. Use when adding try/catch blocks, handling database errors, managing validation failures, or implementing graceful degradation. Apply when working on controller actions that might fail, database operations, external API calls, or file operations. Also use when designing error messages, logging errors, or handling edge cases.

# Global Error Handling

## When to use this skill:

- When adding try/catch blocks to handle exceptions
- When handling database operation failures (save, update, delete)
- When managing model validation errors and displaying them
- When implementing error handling in controller actions
- When handling external API call failures
- When implementing file upload or filesystem error handling
- When designing user-friendly error messages
- When logging errors for debugging purposes
- When implementing graceful degradation
- When handling edge cases and unexpected inputs

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global error handling.
