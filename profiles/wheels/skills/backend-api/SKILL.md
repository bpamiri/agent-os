name: Backend API
description: Build and structure RESTful API endpoints following project conventions. Use when creating API controllers, defining JSON response structures, implementing API authentication, or handling API versioning. Apply when working on files in api/ directories, creating endpoints that return JSON, implementing Bearer token authentication, adding rate limiting, or designing API error responses. Also use when writing .cfc controller files that use renderWith() or provides("json").

# Backend API

## When to use this skill:

- When creating new API endpoints or controllers that return JSON
- When implementing API authentication (Bearer tokens, API keys)
- When designing RESTful routes and HTTP verb mappings
- When working on files in `api/` or `controllers/api/` directories
- When adding API versioning (v1, v2) or namespaced routes
- When implementing API error handling and status codes
- When creating endpoints that use `renderWith()` or `provides("json")`
- When writing integration tests for API endpoints
- When documenting API responses or adding OpenAPI/Swagger specs

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend API development.
